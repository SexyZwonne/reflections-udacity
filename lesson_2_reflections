What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- You get a new folder called .git which contains the meta data for the 
	newly created repository. I need to do it to begin keeping track of my
	files!
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- It's a container for the files we WANT to commit. The working direc-
	tory might have some other files that we don't want to include in our
	commit.
