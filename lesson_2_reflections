What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- You get a new folder called .git which contains the meta data for the 
	newly created repository. I need to do it to begin keeping track of my
	files!
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- It's a container for the files we WANT to commit. The working direc-
	tory might have some other files that we don't want to include in our
	commit.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
	- I put only the files I want to to the staging area, duh...
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?
	- I can experiment without fear of breaking something!! I can see which
	branch is made for what purpose...
