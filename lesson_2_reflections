What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- You get a new folder called .git which contains the meta data for the 
	newly created repository. I need to do it to begin keeping track of my
	files!
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- It's a container for the files we WANT to commit. The working direc-
	tory might have some other files that we don't want to include in our
	commit.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
	- I put only the files I want to to the staging area, duh...
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?
	- I can experiment without fear of breaking something!! I can see which
	branch is made for what purpose...
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	- More clearly, obviously...
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it 
in the diagram the way we do?
	-The result is the union of all the files (and changes made to them)
	on both branches. We represent it that way so we can see it more
	clearly.
	
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing 
merges manually?
	- Automatic merging can save time, but it's not perfect, because when
	there are conflicts, automatic merging does not work well, it would
	have to take a guess as to what it is that needs merging. Manual
	merging is slower, but it gives the user power in solving conflicts.
