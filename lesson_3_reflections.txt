Would you rather want to create a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
	- Well, I don't have any preferences so far, I think both are ok, but a 
  remote repository can probably be more safe when working with other 
  people...
  
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- Because if I work in a large team, and they push thir changes often,
	it would be resource-consuming to automatically pull changes all the 
	time...
